# Code-Refractor-Accessibility-Ch1-

## Description

I was asked by a marketing agency to help clean up the code for their website. Ultimately, they wanted a page that followed accessibility standards so the website was optimized for search engines. I found a lot of unnecessary elements when going into the code. While it functioned, it was difficult to understand, and not as simplified as possible. I have since changed divisions into more semantic tags, deleted and reorgnaized classes that were not needed, movied everything into a more sequential order on both the html and css documents, and left comments to describe these updates. I now have a better understanding on how to code refract, and can make websites more accessible if asked by a future client.

## Usage

The Header and Naviagation bar are used for organizational purposes. They give the name of the agency, along with links to sections of the website that might be of interest. Following is a picture that shows what the average work environemnt is like for the company, showing clients that Horiseon can be relied upon. And the second half of the page has a main section and aside section, both containing information that enlightens workers and clients about the important facts and goals for Horiseon.
